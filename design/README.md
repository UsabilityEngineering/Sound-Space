## Upload 

Below is an image of our Upload page which ca be navigated to by clicking the plus icon in the navbar:

<img src="./artboards/upload.PNG" width="400" alt="Upload Page for Soundspace">

Shown above is the Upload page for our Soundspace website. On this page of the website, users would be able to upload songs or videos to songs to Soundspace. The main interaction on this page would be how when a user clicks the two big plus buttons, they will be able to upload files. For the "Upload a video" section, we added a small form where users would be able to input which song that they would like to upload. When a user clicks "Search for a song" or "Choose your hashtags" the following will appear under the box:

This is a place where the user can select which song they would like to attribute their video to. They can also add multiple hashtags to their video so that more users can find their video easier. 

We expect [personas](../requirements/personas-and-scenarios2.pdf) like Ivory Williams and Lil' Potato to use this page to upload their music, dance videos, and other content to Soundspace.

On this page there is also the navbar which follows the same convention on every page.

## Discover/Trending 

Finally, we have the Discover and Trending page which can be navigated to by clicking the compass icon in the navbar:

<img src="./artboards/discover-trending-1.PNG" width="400"> <img src="./artboards/discover-trending-2.PNG" width="400"> 

This page is focused on showing our users a variety of videos based on a filter they are searching under. For the purpose of our wireframe, a simple example of our website, we used music genres as a base filter. The first image above shows how the page would look once someone arrives at the page. The next picture is showing what the screen would look like if the user clicked the "Pop" filter. These two images together shows the interaction we want for this page.

We expect [personas](../requirements/personas-and-scenarios2.pdf) like Steven Williams to use this page often so that they can find interesting content on the go. Personas like Jeremy Jones might not use this page as much since they are looking for content that is extremely specific.
