# Requirements Gathering

### Introduction:
The following report was created by [Christian Hodges](https://github.com/chodges7) and [Sufiyan Syed](https://github.com/SufiyanSyedCSUC). Our project name and team name is Sound Space and this is our **Phase I: Requirements Gathering** report.

### Methods:
- Survey: We chose to use a survey to get large sample data on music streaming and video user behavior 
	- Consisted of 32 participants answering both quantitative and qualitative questions

- Studying Documentation: Performed studying documentation to get secondary research and overall data on users/problem space
	- Short literature review of past UX studies in Music and Video streaming and Cultural data on user habits

- Contextual Inquiry: We chose to do a contextual inquiry to get qualitative data and understand the contexts where individuals listen to music and watch music videos. 
	- Consisted of 3 participants answering interview questions about music listening habits and Ethnographic observations. 


### Findings:
- Survey: 
	- "How Old are you?" 
		- <img src="./survey-graphs/1-age.png" width="500">
		- Ages ranged from 19-47 with most observations ranging from 19 to 22
	- "On average, how many hours do you stream/listen to music in a day?"
		- For this question, our response ranged from 30 minutes to 12 hours in an average day. But most of the responses ranged from 4-5 hours long.
	- "What are some places or situations where you usually stream music?"
		- As expected from this type of question on a survey, each response to this question was unique to the person. Because of this here are some of the overarching places or situations where folks listened to music:
			- Driving, doing homework, at the gym, cooking, traveling, showering, and cleaning
	- "How frequently do you use the following applications for listening/streaming to music?"
		- <img src="./survey-graphs/2-how-frequent-streaming.png" width="500">
		- The graph created from this response shows us how popular each of the following apps are with our participants in regards to listening to music. This graph shows that TikTok, Apple Music, Tidal, SoundCloud, and Musi are not popular among our participants and conclusions that use those applications should be taken with a grain of salt.


- For each method, describe:
	- the users you collected data from (demographics and how they [mis]represent your user base) and
	- summarize the findings point-by-point (for example, the distribution of answers for a multiple-choice question). If you are researching existing software and/or competitor software, you should include pictures with call-outs that point out both important features and flaws within the interface.

### Conclusions:
foo

- Discoveries derived from the method(s). For example, explain a requirement (e.g. new user story based on a persona) based on a finding (e.g. “. . . because in our contextual inquiry, we found it was what the users did most often and complained about extraneous work needed to complete it”)

### Caveats:
The participants in our survey were primarily rural college students living in Chico, CA. The demographics of our survey’s respondents were also largely Computer Science majors. Since a large part of our application is about creating musical content, interest in this type of application could be skewed from the participants that we surveyed. Another limitation that we found in our gathering methods was that we did not ask a lot of questions about how folks discover new music that they would like/interact with.

### Personas:
foo

- Provide profiles of each of your user personas, which represent (potential) archetypes of users of your software

### Scenarios:
foo

- Identify the primary scenarios for your software and for each, include a description that explains who (of your personas) and what they want to do. Each persona should be involved in at least one scenario.
