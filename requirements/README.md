# Requirements Gathering

### Introduction:
The following report was created by [Christian Hodges](https://github.com/chodges7) and [Sufiyan Syed](https://github.com/SufiyanSyedCSUC). Our project name and team name is Sound Space and this is our **Phase I: Requirements Gathering** report.

### Methods:
- Survey: We chose to use a survey to get large sample data on music streaming and video user behavior 
	- Consisted of 32 participants answering both quantitative and qualitative questions

- Studying Documentation: Our Studying Documentation looked at past contextual inquiries and UX case studies relating to our problem space by each competitor. 
	- Short literature review of past UX studies in Music and Video streaming and Cultural data on user habits

- Contextual Inquiry: Our contextual inquiry consisted of naturalistic observation and short interviews 
	- Investigated the relationship between screen attentiveness and streaming music  
	- behavioral attitudes on music videos and music sharing.
	- Consisted of 3 participants answering interview questions about music listening habits and Ethnographic observations. 


### Findings:
- Studying Documentation 
	-  Spotify user habits, attitudes, or notable information 
	  	- Checking social media becomes part of a daily routine 
		- Music streaming services should have a large library of songs that is constantly updated
		- It is important that the app is able to be used whenever/wherever 
		- Spotify users use the app almost every day
		- Users consider listening to music to a personal experience that connects artists with their listeners 
		- Users value social media as a way to engage with others 
		- Frustrated with the separation between social media and the music sharing experience

	- Tiktok user habits, attitudes, or notable information 
		- Short Videos conforms to users short attention span and busy lives 
		- Infinite Scroll UI provides a user experience where a user can easily access, browse and discover content 
		- User-made content offers a surprising and endless content for the user

	- Soundcloud user habits, attitudes, or notable information
		- Inclusion of up and coming artists allows a unique catalog 
		- Social media features like profiles, commenting, and liking. 
		- High discoverability of new content 
		- Build artist identity and exposure 
		- Prefer Youtube to market videos and images 
  		- No messaging function hinders artist collaboration

	- Youtube user habits, attitudes, or notable information 
		- People find out about new releases in a somewhat fragmented way (social media, news sites, their streaming service sometimes)
		- Some people expressed frustration about missing shows or new releases simply because they got lost in the noise or didn’t remember to seek 				  out this info on their own.
		- Some people are relying on other services to discover, but most people just hear about it through social media or word of mouth.

	- Apple Music user habits, attitudes, or notable information 
		- People find out about new releases in a somewhat fragmented way (social media, news sites, their streaming service sometimes)
		- Some people in my interviews expressed frustration about missing shows or new releases simply because they got lost in the noise or didn’t remember to seek 			out this info on their own.
		- Some people are relying on other services to satisfy this need for them, but most people just hear about it through social media or word of mouth.


- Survey: 
	- "How Old are you?" 
		- <img src="./survey-graphs/1-age.png" width="500">
		- Ages ranged from 19-47 with most observations ranging from 19 to 22
	- "On average, how many hours do you stream/listen to music in a day?"
		- For this question, our response ranged from 30 minutes to 12 hours in an average day. But most of the responses ranged from 4-5 hours long. (Avg. = 4.708, Med. = 3.75)
	- "What are some places or situations where you usually stream music?"
		- As expected from this type of question on a survey, each response to this question was unique to the person. Because of this here are some of the overarching places or situations where folks listened to music:
			- Driving, doing homework, at the gym, cooking, traveling, showering, and cleaning
	- "How frequently do you use the following applications for listening/streaming to music?"
		- <img src="./survey-graphs/2-how-frequent-streaming.png" width="500">
		- The graph created from this response shows us how popular each of the following apps are with our participants in regards to listening to music. This graph shows that TikTok, Apple Music, Tidal, SoundCloud, and Musi are not popular among our participants and conclusions that use those applications should be taken with a grain of salt.
	- "On a scale of 1-5, please answer the following questions about listening/streaming music:"
		- <img src="./survey-graphs/3-questions-streaming.png" width="500">
		- This graph shows that many of our participants stream music by themselves, at home, and at work and school. Though there is a little bit of a drop off for folks who listen with others as compared to the other rows in this question.
	- "On average, how many hours do you watch music videos or clips in a day?"
		- This was an interesting question because the lowest answer we got was 0 hrs while our biggest answer was 10 hours in a day. Though that answer is certainly an outlier and the majority of our answers were under or at an hour. (Avg. = 2.179, Med. = 1)
	- "What are some places or situations where you usually watch music videos or clips?"
		- There were some answers that were similar to the last question asking about what situations would one listen/stream music, but most of the answers became similar to, "while in bed" or "at home." Some interesting answers include, "when [I] know that there is a good music video to a song maybe i’ll go find that video" and "If an artist I like releases a music video to a song I enjoy." These two responses capture the feeling that Sound Space wants to emulate.
	- "How Frequently to you use the following applications for interacting with videos linked to music (ex: Music Videos, Dance Challenges, AMVs, etc.)?"
		- <img src="./survey-graphs/4-how-frequent-videos.png" width="500">
		- This graph is intesting because it shows that folks who are looking to watch music videos will go to YouTube, Spotify, and TikTok instead of going to Apple Music, Tidal, SoundCloud, or Musi.
	- "On a scale of 1-5, please answer the following questions about watching music videos/clips:"
		- <img src="./survey-graphs/5-questions-videos.png" width="500">
		- The use of this question was to see in what situations do folks watch music videos in comparison to just listening/streaming music. I think what we can gather from this chart is that folks are more likely to interact with music videos when they are alone, in small groups, and in places that are familer like home. 
	- "On a 4 point scale, do you prefer watching music videos or streaming music?"
		- <img src="./survey-graphs/6-prefer-videos-or-streaming.png" width="500">
		- The focus of this question was to get a gauge on how much users would prefer listening to music versus watching music videos. 1 in this graph is watching videos and 4 is streaming music. This question isn't the greatest in retrospect because there is a lot let barrier to entry when listening/streaming music and therefore it will be easier and more likable in general scenarios. Though, we can still gleam from this question that there is a sub-set of people who like watching music videos.
	- "On a scale from 1 to 5, how often do you leave comments on videos linked to music (ex: Music Videos, TikTok challenges/dances, AMVs, etc.)?"
		- <img src="./survey-graphs/7-leave-comments.png" width="500">
		- 1 for this chart = never, 5 for this chart = very often. This chart shows us that folks generally don't leave comments on videos so this means that we should have an option for comments, but we should not make it a very large portion of our UI since it is not important to the major userbase based off of this survey.
	- "On a scale of 1-4, do you agree with the following statement: When I comment on musical content, the comments are generally positive."
		- <img src="./survey-graphs/8-comments-generally-positive.png" width="500">
		- 1 for this chart = Stronly Disagree, 4 for this chart = Strongly Agree. This shows us that when users comment on posts it is probably because they liked it so much that they wanted to show their support for the piece of content.
	- "How Frequently to you share musical content to your friends from each of these applications? Please answer n/a if you don't use the application."
		- <img src="./survey-graphs/9-how-frequently-share.png" width="500">
		- This final chart shows us that when folks are using platforms like TikTok, YouTube, Spotify, and SoundCloud, they will probably have a piece of musical content during their use that they will share with friends. A caveat for this chart is that earlier we saw that not many of the participants in this survey used applications that weren't YouTube, Spotify, and TikTok. This means that data in the other sections could be skewed upward to have more weight, and the data for YouTube, Spotify, and TikTok might be skewed down since a lot more of the participants use those services.

Contextual Inquiry 

In our naturalistic observation segment of our contextual inquiry we observed music streamers to see how much and in what ways they are attentive to their phone and computer screens. In outdoor contexts where individuals were traveling in between destinations by foot, around 43% percent of the people we saw maintained some attention to their phone, often texting and checking social media. While some individuals were observed watching videos, the majority of individuals observed in this context was listening to music passively while actively focusing on reaching their destination. This finding is also largely due to the increased number of distractions people have when traveling in between destinations like cars, bikes, skateboards, other people, etc. 

Due to the passive nature of music streaming, we shifted our observations to music streamers in the library of CSU. Since students in the library had a primary focus of completing their work, almost all of the individuals observed were listening to music passively. We used the floor structure of the library to act as a control for different contexts and passive auditory/visual attentiveness. In the third floor or “quiet floor” where the majority of individuals are working individually, we observed very high screen attention with individuals listening to music and checking social media as they take breaks from their work. One notable individual was watching a youtube video unrelated to her work as she was working on her homework. This was an interesting observation as it helped us understand the practice of passive visuals. Similar to the common practice of listening to music passively while doing other tasks, we found numerous individuals watching videos in the background as they were doing other tasks. When we observed the fourth floor or “group study” floor we saw that not that many individuals were listening to music at all yet we saw a group of students watching videos as they were working together on assignments. Through these observations we found that in group settings, watching videos passively is a viable scenario to include into the soundspace design. 

In a non-academic context we observed individuals in a coffee shop working, relaxing and taking advantage of the free wifi. Of these observations we found many individuals to be listening to music and watching videos more actively like they would do so at home. 

During and after our naturalistic observations we interviewed some of the people we observed to get more specific data. The three participants we received mostly confirmed our ethnographic observations and survey data but interviewing them allowed us to be more investigative in why individuals were behaving this way. Users described their music streaming habits as being complementary to some other action they are performing. It became increasingly clear that designing an app for passive listening and watching is critical for both social and individual scenarios. Notably, one interviewee was an avid tiktok user and it was interesting to understand how they used the app in relation to music. Tiktok users are unique in that they use this app in an active way such that using the app is their primary action when they are using it. We concluded that this was due to the short duration of videos on tiktok which accommodated for short attention spans and allowed for use in short intervals whenever the user has free time. 

In terms of music discovery and sharing, tiktok and spotify were commonly used to share and discover music while sharing was done primarily between close relationships and previous individual interests. In addition, the respondents said they rarely commented on videos or music but more so talked about their music preferences and interests on social media platforms. One interviewee was a musician and expressed the need for new ways to market music. He noted the role music videos had on marketing the most popular songs and the impact tiktok has had on music marketing in recent years. 


### Conclusions:

Based on the findings of studying documentation, we formed the following conclusions. 
	- tiktok UI’s infinite vertical scroll bar is essential to a convenient and easy experience as an audio-visual app. 
	- Social media integration and engagement with the artist is a need of streaming services 
	- Artists need creative ways to get exposure 
	- Addressing needs and pains of youtube music is necessary as 2 billion individuals visit youtube each month to consume music related conent
	- Soundpace should promote music discovery as current methods are ineffective and inefficient

Some conclusions that we can gather from the survey section of this requirements gathering phase is that watching music videos is not the most popular this in regards to music since when we asked participants about wether they liked streaming music versus watching music videos we had a clear bias towards streaming. A new user story based on this conclusion would be that the general user would like an option to stream their music with their phone screen turned off since many situations where folks interact with music include doing other tasks like working out or cleaning.

Another conclusion that we found from the survey would be that YouTube, Spotify, and TikTok are the most used applications that stream music and showcase music videos in our userbase. A user story for this conclusion is as follows: A user who uses YouTube, Spotify, and TikTok would appreciate a link to the music video on YouTube, a link to the song on Spotify, or a link to the tags used in the video on TikTok so that they can use those apps in conjunction with Sound Space.

Based on the findings from our contextual inquiry, we formed the following conclusions. We concluded that designing an experience for passive music streaming and passive video watching is essential for both social and individual scenarios. Throughout our design we found an unmet need for watching videos passively in social and individual situations and this could be a central usability feature of soundpace. To appease the passive user audience, it is essential for soundspace to have a design similar to a traditional music/video streaming desktop/mobile app. 

In addition we found that the number of scenarios where the user actively watches videos or streams music as their primary activity is limited and similar to contexts of youtube and other entertainment apps. For this reason we think that soundpace should design for use in similar contexts to youtube in terms of entertainment, tiktok in terms of social media, and soundcloud in terms of music marketing and unique content. 

One important finding we found was the significance of video length in terms of potential usability. Based on our analysis of tiktok user behavior we concluded that the shorter the video, the more contexts the app can be used in due to accommodating short attention spans in users and allowing active use. In addition to short videos, we concluded that increasing social features and a design resembling a social media platform would increase active use as users being socially connected to others would increase their engagement with the content. 

We also concluded that music discovery (includes sharing) among music streamings is fragmented. Tiktok was found to be used in discovery and sharing and we think looking further into those features designs could be useful. Lastly we concluded that marketing is another central usability feature, as soundspace could be used to promote new music and gain artist exposure. 


### Caveats:
The participants in our survey were primarily rural college students living in Chico, CA. The demographics of our survey’s respondents were also largely Computer Science majors. Since a large part of our application is about creating musical content, interest in this type of application could be skewed from the participants that we surveyed. Another limitation that we found in our gathering methods was that we did not ask a lot of questions about how folks discover new music that they would like/interact with.

For our contextual inquiry we made several assumptions that limit the significance of our study. First when we were observing individuals listening to music, we made the assumption that them having earbuds, earphones, or headphones meant that they were listening to music. Furthermore, individuals perhaps on a phone call or listening to a podcast would skew the data. In addition we measured screen attention simply by seeing if an individual was paying attention to a screen. Whether or not the user was texting, watching youtube, or reading a news article, was not recorded and that could skew the significance of the data as it unknown how individuals would behave specifically to watching music videos while listening to music. In addition, in our observations in the library, zoom and video/auditory assignments were commonly being done which could also skew the significance of the results.
