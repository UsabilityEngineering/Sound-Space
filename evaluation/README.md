# Evaluation

## Background

Our background questions were designed to see how the participants feel about music and music videos. What we learned was that the participants we had in our usability test were very interested in music and discovering new music. Something else we found was that there were folks who really liked music videos and some that did not care for them as much. One of the participants, p04, liked music videos as an idea, but they did not seek out music videos unless it was by an artist that they really enjoyed. Every one of our participants stated that they used YouTube as their main way to find music videos. Some also mentioned Google.

Each of the tasks had two Likert questions: 
- On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is "*very difficult*" and 5 is "*very easy*" how would you rate this task?
- On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is "*very confusing*" and 5 is "*very intuitive*" how would you rate this task?

## Task 1

The goal of the first task was to see if a user would be able to use the navigation bar on the side of the screen to find their account and upload a piece of media.

The first half of this task was extremely simple for the participants. Some of them used the "Log In" button in the top right of the Home page, while other just clicked the "Account" button on the navigation bar. This was also the first time that the participants were using the prototype to type data so some of them didn't know that they were supposed to click the "email" and "password" boxes to input the data. 

**Difficulty scale: 4**

We believe that we got this score because some of our participants had a tough time finding where to upload their content. Another thing that p04 found confusing was that they did not know why we were using URLs in the upload section. They asked, "shouldn't they be file uploads?" This is a fair question and should be a provided option instead of a URL to another website.

**Confusion scale: 4**

We also got a 4 on average in this question. We think that this is because once folks found the account and upload sections on the left-hand side of the screen it was a very intuitive thing to remember and use from then on.

## Task 2

The goal of the second task was to test the usability of the approval process.

Half participants had an easy time with this task, but the other half had an extremely bad time. Participant number 5, p05, even failed the task and did not know where to go. One reason why this happened was that there is nowhere to find which approvals are waiting on the user. Another reason is that this was a difficult task to explain to our participants.

**Difficulty scale: 3.4**

This is a fair difficulty for this task on our prototype. One of the main takeaways from this usability test is that we have a lot to improve on our approval process. The difficulty for this task should be between a 4 and 5, but the difficulty is about 3. One way to improve the approval process is to visualize the amount of waiting approvals that are connected to a piece of music on your account.

**Confusion scale 3**

Again this linked back to our difficulty scale. We feel like this is the area that could be most improved from our prototype. We already talked about some ways to lower the overall difficulty of the task, but one way that we could lower the confusion of the task could be to show a list of approved media linked to a song on your account. This would allow the user to know what pieces of media are connected to theirs.

## Task 3

The goal of the third task was to see how well the user could check the popularity of their own song and if they could navigate the trending page. 

This task was seen as our easiest task in the entire test. This I think makes sense because the participants had now had the most time with the prototype and the task overall was easy to understand. One participant, p04, had some great feedback that they did not understand at first why there were two titles on the trending page. One of us started to explain but then they understood by themselves that one was the title of the music video and the other was the title of the song. They suggested that we add a music note to the title of the song to make that more obvious.

**Difficulty scale 5**

All of our participants rated this task very easy which was very nice to see. Participant number 2, p02, was particularly happy about how easy this task was. They realized after one of us explained the task to them that all they had to do was click on the trending page. They stated, "this sounds presumptuous, but my song might be on the trending page." Though if the participant did not see their song on the trending page then they could also get the stats from the account page which was very easy to get to.

**Confusion scale 4**

We had mostly all 4s with one 3 and one 5. The one middling rating stated that they gave a 3 because they were confused about the tabs on the account page. Because of how the tabs were spaced, they thought that the video they approved would show up under the "videos" button on their account when in reality that tab would show which videos the user has uploaded. In the future, we will have to make the idea that those are tabs and not columns more visible.

## Wrap Up

Finally, we had the wrap-up portion of our usability test. We will showcase each of the questions in a list as well as their general answers from the usability test.

#### What did you **dislike** most about SoundSpace?
- There's too much work to approve content
- The info on the account page could be organized better
- There was a lack of clarity on some of the tabs and trending page
- Approval system is confusing

#### What did you **like** most about SoundSpace?
- The trending tab is cool
- Aesthetics and color pallette are nice to look at
- Design in clean and it is easy to locate things
- They liked the idea of uploading fan-made content and being able to show off your creativity

#### What are some **additional features** that you would like to see in SoundSpace?
- A friends feature
- A way to sort the trending page, either by genre or using a filter
- Have a "verified" check similar to Twitter for artists
- None, improve what is in the prototype now

#### What are your feelings about the following features:
- Approval Process:
  - Confusing, there isn't enough feedback for the user
  - I like how one can moderate content
  - Approvals might be cumbersome to bigger creators if they have a lot of approvals to go through but could be great for smaller creators so that they curate the content connected to theirs.
- Uploading Content
  - It pretty easy, just put in the info and hit submit
  - It was cool and pretty straightforward, but the URLs item on the form is confusing

#### Any other **thoughts or comments** that you would like to share with us?
- In general, cool idea for a place with both music and music videos
- I liked the trending tab
- I think there should also be a way to edit your profile or delete uploaded content.
