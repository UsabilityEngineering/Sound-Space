[View on GitHub Pages](https://usabilityengineering.github.io/Sound-Space/)

Sound Space is about breaking the barrier between a music streaming service and social media app. Sound Space is a platform to upload, stream, share and artistically compete using both music and associated visual content like visualizers, short clips, and full music videos.

# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

**Executive Summary**

Overall Findings:

- Most of the folks that we surveyed stated that they prefered **listening/streaming music** over watching music videos
- When folks watch music videos, they usually do that at **home and by themselves**.
- From the sample of the population we surveyed, they don't comment very often, but when they do interact with musical content, it is generally **positive**.
- Users of current music streaming and video apps are in need of **social, sharing and discovering** features
- A convenient and simple UI is critical for users with **short attention spans.**
- The act of music streaming and video watching can be done both **actively and passively**, of which correspond to diffrent contexts.  

Conclusions:

- Watching music videos is **not as popular** as listening or streaming music
- We believe that this is because listening to music has a **smaller barrier to entry.**
- Sound Space as an application should focus on users that want to **interact** and **create** musical content.
- Sound Space should also focus on our users being able to share content easily to encourage **positive communication** and allow **creative marketing opportunities** for       artists.
- Sound Space should be designed to be used both **actively and passively** by users.
