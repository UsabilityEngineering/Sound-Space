[View on GitHub Pages](https://usabilityengineering.github.io/Sound-Space/)

Sound Space is about breaking the barrier between a music streaming service and social media app. Sound Space is a platform to upload, stream, share and artistically compete using both music and associated visual content like visualizers, short clips, and full music videos.

# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

**Executive Summary**

Overall Findings:

- Most of the folks that we surveyed stated that they prefered listening/streaming music over watching music videos
- When folks watch music videos, they usually do that at home and by themselves.
- From the sample of the population we surveyed, they don't comment very often, but when they do interact with musical content, it is generally positive.
- !!! Studying documentation finding 1
- !!! Studying documentation finding 2
- !!! Contextual Enquiery finding

Conclusions:

- Watching music videos is not as popular as listening or streaming music
- We believe that this is because listening to music has a smaller barrier to entry. 
- Sound Space as an application should focus on users that want to interact and create musical content.
- Sound Space should also focus on our users being able to share content easily to encourage positive communication.
