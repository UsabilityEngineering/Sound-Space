# Requirements Gathering

### Introduction:
The following report was created by [Christian Hodges](https://github.com/chodges7) and [Sufiyan Syed](https://github.com/SufiyanSyedCSUC). Our project name and team name is Sound Space and this is our **Phase I: Requirements Gathering** report.

### Methods:
- Survey:
	- Foo
- Studying Documentation:
	- Foo
- Contextual Enquirey:
	- Foo

- Describe (A) Methods you used (B) Why you used them, and (C) Number of users (e.g. n=10) for each method

### Findings:
foo

- For each method, describe:
	- the users you collected data from (demographics and how they [mis]represent your user base) and
	- summarize the findings point-by-point (for example, the distribution of answers for a multiple-choice question). If you are researching existing software and/or competitor software, you should include pictures with call-outs that point out both important features and flaws within the interface.

### Conclusions:
foo

- Discoveries derived from the method(s). For example, explain a requirement (e.g. new user story based on a persona) based on a finding (e.g. “. . . because in our contextual inquiry, we found it was what the users did most often and complained about extraneous work needed to complete it”)

### Caveats:
foo

- Considerations and/or limitations to the method(s) you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc.

### Personas:
foo

- Provide profiles of each of your user personas, which represent (potential) archetypes of users of your software

### Scenarios:
foo

- Identify the primary scenarios for your software and for each, include a description that explains who (of your personas) and what they want to do. Each persona should be involved in at least one scenario.
