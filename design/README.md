# Interaction Design

Based on our data collected from our research, we established three main insights to structure our wireframe design. We focused our design efforts on incorporating design features that 

* Accommodate passive use 

In our applications competitive market we found that applications that were designed to allow use whenever and wherever resulted in increased usability. Examples of this include interfaces that allow the user to stream content directly upon opening the application like Tiktok and having favorited or recently played content on the home screen of the app like Spotify. This trend is largely found to accommodate short attention spans of users and passive use. 

Based on our survey investigating situations where music is streamed, we found common answers of which included “traveling, working, and cleaning”, that indicated a trend for passive use when listening to music. Additionally, our ethnographic observations of music consumers traveling between destinations and working individually as well as socially; found that users stream content in a passive manner.

Contrary to this, our survey investigating situations where music videos are consumed, we found common answers of which included “At Home, Relaxing, and with friends”, that indicated a trend for active use. This is further supported by our ethnographic observations of visual content consumption in a coffee shop. 

Since our project aims to include both music streaming and associated visual content, we decided it was important to note the differences in how both these types of media are consumed for our designs. 

* Promote sharing and discovery between users 

In our applications competitive market we found that users of soundspace’s competitors value social media as a way to engage with others regarding music and were frustrated with the separation between social media and the music sharing experience. This aligns with the common trend that music consumers discover music in a fragmented way, typically through social media or word of mouth. Our data collected from our contextual inquiry supports this as interviewees described discovering music through recommendations from friends and family; and through personal interests. 

Based on our survey data we found that apps most used to share music or music related content included Tiktok, Youtube, Spotify, and SoundCloud. To influence our design we understood that designs common among these applications should be included in Soundspace including the location of commenting, liking, messaging, following, and hashtag features. 

* Promote engagement between artists and consumers 

In our applications competitive market, we found that users of soundspace’s competitors find listening to music a personal experience that connects them with artists, while artists find these platforms to build identity, collaborate with other artists, and gain exposure among consumers. Particularly messaging and commenting was found to be a critical feature for artist collaboration and connecting to fans. 

Our survey results found that music video consumers rarely leave comments on videos so finding ways to increase commenting was explored when creating our wireframes. 

Additionally Interviewee responses from our contextual inquiry, noted the use of social media and visual media to market and promote music and designing soundspace for the perspective of a content creator was considered 

To begin, the page serving as the central focus to our app is shown below and always appears when a user first logs into their account.

## Stream 

To begin, the page serving as the central focus to our app is shown below and always appears when a user first logs into their account.

<img src="../design/artboards/Stream Page Idea 1.png" width="400">

The user is met with the browsing and video playback layout of the streaming page. On the left side, the user can browse songs by scrolling vertically while browsing the multiple videos for each song horizontally through the two arrow keys on each side of the page. In this wireframe each color corresponds to a song while multiple boxes with the same color refer to various videos for each song. The user can then use the scroll bar on the right to change the song and see videos for that song

<img src="../design/artboards/Stream Page Idea 1 – 1.png" width="400">

This design was chosen primarily to accommodate passive use as it allows the user to visually browse both songs and videos and can be easily left playing in the background while the user’s attention span is limited. This layout also allows the user to use the app actively, similar to a traditional Youtube user experience. 

On the right side of the screen is the playback box where visual content is shown. Within the video box itself are icons that allow the user to enable fullscreen, repeat, shuffle, skip, replay/rewind, and pause/play. Below the video box is a video progress bar and a list of hashtags associated with the video. Below this are sections that inform the user of the artist of the song and the visual creator. The user can easily see their profile statistics and follow or send a message to each of the creators. To the right of this is a comment box where users can browse, post and reply to comments. On the very top of the playback box is the video title, and interactions that allow the user to socially engage with the video. 

This design was chosen to make engagement and sharing always accessible and easily apparent to the user. In this design the user can easily engage with artists and other consumers, share content, like and favorite newly discovered content to be viewed later. 

Towards the top left side of the screen below the Soundspace logo is the search bar where users can search songs, artists, playlists, or hashtags to access content. To the right of the search bar is a feature that informs the user what is currently being played and their history of recently played songs to be replayed. These two features remain constant throughout the entire interface and user experience. 

This design was chosen to not only allow the user freedom of the application, but also to allow the user to discover content and access favorite or previously watched content. No matter what page the user is on, they will always be able to search for content, see what they are currently playing and what they have played before. 

On the very top of the page is a navigation bar that the user uses to navigate the different pages of the app. Starting from the far right, the four logos represent pages for uploading content, accessing the profile, browsing the trending page, and visiting the library while the Soundspace logo returns you to the stream home page. 

In addition to the search bar and recently played feature, these navigation icons are constant throughout the app’s experience. This design was chosen for its simplicity and efficiency for navigating soundspace

This wireframe for the stream page was intended for all our users but particularly for personas like Steven Williams and Jermey Jones who primarily consume content over uploading content. 

Lets visit the library page by clicking on the icon with the three books. 

## Profile 

### Liked

This shortcut takes the user to his/her profile page where all their related content is located. On this page specifically, the user can browse through their created and liked playlists. 

<img src="../design/artboards/Profile Page idea 1 – 5.png" width="400">

Lets visit the profile page by clicking on the person icon on the top of the screen. This page allows the user to toggle between viewing their liked songs and artists, in addition to accessing their liked or created playlist also accessible through the library icon. Additionally towards the top of the page is information about the profiles posts, followers, and who the user is following. 

We chose this design to first inform the user of their profile statistics and also easily access content associated with their profile. We understood that the library icon directed you to the same page of the profile icon, but we wanted to give the user a faster way to access their frequently viewed content. This aids personas like Steven Williams and Jermey Jones in swiftly acessing their favorite content. 

<img src="../design/artboards/Profile Page idea 1 – 4.png" width="400">

<img src="../design/artboards/Profile Page idea 1 – 6.png" width="400">

If you click to the right of the Liked tab we have the mentions feature

### Mentions 
<img src="../design/artboards/Profile Page idea 1 – 2.png" width="400">

This feature essentially informs the user whenever anyone interacts with their content on the platform, including posting a video to their song or commenting on one of their videos. The user then has the ability to approve or deny it being shown on the app. The artist also has the ability to message any of these individuals, access their profile, or follow them. The user can use the scroll bar on the left side of the screen to browse their past mentions and click on them to view them. 

This was designed to promote artist engagement as it allows a content creator to control posts related to their content on soundspace. The design allows an efficient avenue for artists and personas like Ivory Williams or Lil Potato to engage with their followers as they could easily view a mention, message them, and access their profile all from the same page.

To the right of the mentions page is the messages page, lets click on that 

### Messages 
<img src="../design/artboards/Profile Page idea 1 – 1.png" width="400">

The messages page is dedicated to messaging and communication between users of soundpace. Similar to the mentions tab, the user can browse their past messages on the left hand side and click on each of them. The user can then read the message sent to them and reply and attach content to the message. The user can also access the profile of the sender and give them a follow. Furthermore the user can send a new message by clicking on the “New Message” icon on the top left of the page. 

This wireframe was designed to promote sharing and discoverability. Users can message and collaborate with others on the app and reference other content of the profile tab to send in messages. The user can also easily access the message senders profile to view their content and profile to allow efficient collaboration between artists. 

On the far left of the page is the uploads tab

### Uploads 
<img src="../design/artboards/Profile Page idea 1 – 3.png" width="400">

<img src="../design/artboards/Profile Page idea 1.png" width="400">

The upload tab is where the user can access their own uploaded content. On the very top is a slider which allows the user to toggle between videos and songs. Below this is an engagement tracker that allows the creator to track engagement with their content in real time. Particularly on the songs tab, the creator is able to see all the videos posted to their songs. 

This tab of the profile page was designed to give artists like personas Lil Potato and Ivory Williams feedback and analytics on the content they post to soundspace so they can market and grow their profile. We thought having this positioned right above the users uploaded content and within near access to other content in their profile would allow efficient usability for content creators. In addition, the ability toggle between uploaded songs and videos on the top of the page allows creators to further organize and understand engagement towards their content on the app. 

## Upload 

Below is an image of our Upload page which ca be navigated to by clicking the plus icon in the navbar:

<img src="./artboards/upload.png" width="400" alt="Upload Page for Soundspace">

Shown above is the Upload page for our Soundspace website. On this page of the website, users would be able to upload songs or videos to songs to Soundspace. The main interaction on this page would be how when a user clicks the two big plus buttons, they will be able to upload files. For the "Upload a video" section, we added a small form where users would be able to input which song that they would like to upload. When a user clicks "Search for a song" or "Choose your hashtags" the following will appear under the box:

<img src="./artboards/upload-search-1.png" width="200">

This is a place where the user can select which song they would like to attribute their video to. They can also add multiple hashtags to their video so that more users can find their video easier. 

We expect [personas](../requirements/personas-and-scenarios2.pdf) like Ivory Williams and Lil' Potato to use this page to upload their music, dance videos, and other content to Soundspace.

On this page there is also the navbar which follows the same convention on every page.

## Discover/Trending 

Finally, we have the Discover and Trending page which can be navigated to by clicking the compass icon in the navbar:

<img src="./artboards/discover-trending-1.png" width="400"> <img src="./artboards/discover-trending-2.png" width="400"> 

This page is focused on showing our users a variety of videos based on a filter they are searching under. For the purpose of our wireframe, a simple example of our website, we used music genres as a base filter. The first image above shows how the page would look once someone arrives at the page. The next picture is showing what the screen would look like if the user clicked the "Pop" filter. These two images together shows the interaction we want for this page.

We expect [personas](../requirements/personas-and-scenarios2.pdf) like Steven Williams to use this page often so that they can find interesting content on the go. Personas like Jeremy Jones might not use this page as much since they are looking for content that is extremely specific.
