# Evaluation

## Background

Our background questions were designed to see how the participants feel about music and music videos. What we learned was that the participants we had in our usability test were very intesested in music and discovering new music. Something else we found was that there were folks who really liked music videos and some that did not care for them as much. One of the participants, p04, liked music videos as an idea, but they did not seek out music videos unless it was by an artist that they really enjoyed. Every one of our participants stated that they used YouTube as their main way to find music videos. Some also mentioned Google.

Each of the tasks had two Likert questions: 
- On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is "*very difficult*" and 5 is "*very easy*" how would you rate this task?
- On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is "*very confusing*" and 5 is "*very intuitive*" how would you rate this task?

## Task 1

The goal of first task was to see if a user would be able to use the navigation bar on the side of the screen to find their account and upload a piece of media.

The first half of this task was extremely simple for the participants. Some of the them used the "Log In" button in the top right of the Home page, other just clicked the "Account" button on the navigation bar. This was also the first time that they participants were using the prototype to type data so some of them didn't know that they were supposed to click the "email" and "password" boxes to input the data. 

**Difficulty scale: 4**

We believe that we got this score because some of our participants had a tough time finding where to upload their content. Another thing that p04 found confusing was that they did not know why we were using URLs in the upload section. They asked, "shouldn't they be file uploads?" This is a fair question and should be a provided option instead of a URL to another website.

**Confusion scale: 4**

We also got a 4 on average in this question. We think that this is because once folks found the account and upload sections on the left hand side of the screen it was a very intuitive thing to remember and use from them on.

## Task 2

The goal of the the second task was to test the usability of the approval process.

Half participants had a easy time with this task, but the other half had an extremely bad time. Participant number 5, p05, even failed the task and did not know where to go. One reason why this happened was because there is nowhere to find which approvals are waiting on the user. Another reason is because this was a difficult task to explain to our participants.

**Difficulty scale: 3.4**

This is a fair difficulty for this task on our prototype. One of the main takeaways from this usability test is that we have a lot to improve on our approval process. The difficulty for this task should be between a 4 and 5, but the difficulty is about 3. One way to improve the approval process is to visualize the amount of waiting approvals that are connected to a piece of music on your account.

**Confusion scale 3**

Again this linked back to our difficulty scale. We feel like this is the area that could be most improved from our prototype. We already talked about some ways to lower the overall difficulty of the task, but one way that we could lower the confusion of the task could be to show a list of approved media linked to a song on your account. This would allow the user to know what pieces of medai are connected to theirs.
