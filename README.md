# Sound Space 

[View on GitHub Pages](https://usabilityengineering.github.io/Sound-Space/)

Sound Space is about breaking the barrier between a music streaming service and social media app. Sound Space is a platform to upload, stream, share and artistically compete using both music and associated visual content like visualizers, short clips, and full music videos.

# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

**Executive Summary**

Overall Findings:

- Most of the folks that we surveyed stated that they prefered **listening/streaming music** over watching music videos
- When folks watch music videos, they usually do that at **home and by themselves**.
- From the sample of the population we surveyed, they don't comment very often, but when they do interact with musical content, it is generally **positive**.
- Users of current music streaming and video apps are in need of **social, sharing and discovering** features
- A convenient and simple UI is critical for users with **short attention spans.**
- The act of music streaming and video watching can be done both **actively and passively**, of which correspond to diffrent contexts.  

Conclusions:

- Watching music videos is **not as popular** as listening or streaming music
- We believe that this is because listening to music has a **smaller barrier to entry.**
- Sound Space as an application should focus on users that want to **interact** and **create** musical content.
- Sound Space should also focus on our users being able to share content easily to encourage **positive communication** and allow **creative marketing opportunities** for       artists.
- Sound Space should be designed to be used both **actively and passively** by users.

# Phase 2: Interaction Design

**Executive Summary**

In this phase of the project, we started designing what we would belive would be a good design for the Soundspace product. In this we created a Adobe XD project with multiple artboards, a canvas in Adobe XD's workspace, that have what we believe are good layouts for each of the pages for Soundspace.

- One can see the artboards we created [here](./design/SoundSpace%20Wireframes%20.pdf) or in a link in our [User centered design artifacts](https://github.com/UsabilityEngineering/Sound-Space#user-centered-design-artifacts) section.
- One can also see the simple prototype we create with those artboards [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/3312afb3-c8a2-4068-8f52-79965d5bff20-6641/?fullscreen&hints=off). or in the [User centered design artifacts](https://github.com/UsabilityEngineering/Sound-Space#user-centered-design-artifacts) section.

We also recieved some feedback from our prototype during one of our in-class labs. We recieved feedback based on [Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). We recieved generally good feedback from those who evaluated our prototype with some of the following notes:
- Our weakest heuristic was "Help and Documentation" because there was no way for a user to get help if they got confused.
- A heuristic to work on was "Aesthetic and Minimalist Design." The feedback we recieved in this area is that the design of our layout was busy in some areas.
- The rest of the heuristics we did fairly well on based on the feedback we recieved in the lab.
