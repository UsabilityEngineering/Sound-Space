# Sound Space 

[View on GitHub Pages](https://usabilityengineering.github.io/Sound-Space/)

Sound Space is about breaking the barrier between a music streaming service and social media app. Sound Space is a platform to upload, stream, share and artistically compete using both music and associated visual content like visualizers, short clips, and full music videos.

# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

**Executive Summary**

Overall Findings:

- Most of the folks that we surveyed stated that they prefered **listening/streaming music** over watching music videos
- When folks watch music videos, they usually do that at **home and by themselves**.
- From the sample of the population we surveyed, they don't comment very often, but when they do interact with musical content, it is generally **positive**.
- Users of current music streaming and video apps are in need of **social, sharing and discovering** features
- A convenient and simple UI is critical for users with **short attention spans.**
- The act of music streaming and video watching can be done both **actively and passively**, of which correspond to diffrent contexts.  

Conclusions:

- Watching music videos is **not as popular** as listening or streaming music
- We believe that this is because listening to music has a **smaller barrier to entry.**
- Sound Space as an application should focus on users that want to **interact** and **create** musical content.
- Sound Space should also focus on our users being able to share content easily to encourage **positive communication** and allow **creative marketing opportunities** for       artists.
- Sound Space should be designed to be used both **actively and passively** by users.

# Phase 2: Interaction Design

**Executive Summary**

In this phase of the project, we started designing what we would belive would be a good design for the Soundspace product. In this we created a Adobe XD project with multiple artboards, a canvas in Adobe XD's workspace, that have what we believe are good layouts for each of the pages for Soundspace.

- One can see the artboards we created [here](./design/SoundSpace%20Wireframes%20.pdf) or in a link in our [User centered design artifacts](https://github.com/UsabilityEngineering/Sound-Space#user-centered-design-artifacts) section.
- One can also see the simple prototype we create with those artboards [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/3312afb3-c8a2-4068-8f52-79965d5bff20-6641/?fullscreen&hints=off). or in the [User centered design artifacts](https://github.com/UsabilityEngineering/Sound-Space#user-centered-design-artifacts) section.

Based on our data collected from our research, we established three main insights to structure our wireframe design. We focused our design efforts on incorporating design features that **accommodate passive use, promote sharing and discovery between users, and promote engagement among artists and consumers**.

Based on these insights, wireframes completed for this deliverable included included four main pages 
* **Stream**
    * The primarily page of the app that allows users to **stream, search for and interact with content.** 
* **Profile**
    * The page containing all information regarding the users profile with subsections **Uploads, Liked, Mentions, and Messages**.
        * **Uploads** subsection allows users to view their uploaded content and their engagement analytics simultaneously
        * **Liked** subsection reflects all user liked content, including created playlists 
        * **Mentions** subsection notifies users when someone uses their profile or content in another post.
        * **Message** subsection allows user to send new messages and track old ones.  
* **Discover**
    * This page focuses on the user being able to filter new content that has been uploaded to Soundspace. One of the main ways a user could filter their content is based on the genre of the music.
* **Upload**
    * Finally, this page allows the user to upload music or upload musical content linked to a song of their choice.

We also recieved some feedback from our prototype during one of our in-class labs. We recieved feedback based on [Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). We recieved generally good feedback from those who evaluated our prototype with some of the following notes:
- Our weakest heuristic was "Help and Documentation" because there was no way for a user to get help if they got confused.
- A heuristic to work on was "Aesthetic and Minimalist Design." The feedback we recieved in this area is that the design of our layout was busy in some areas.
- The rest of the heuristics we did fairly well on based on the feedback we recieved in the lab.

# Phase 3: Usability Evaluation

**Executive Summary**

* Background 
    - Participants in this usability test consume music **very frequently** and are representative of our target user base **homologously** 
    - Participants typically consume music videos on **Youtube**
* Task 1 
    - Login and accessing account 
        - **5 out of 5** users successful 
        - Task completed with relative efficiency but issues regarding our prototype's **fidelity** resulted in some confusion. 
    - Upload a song 
        - **4 out of 5** users successful
        - Task failure resulted from confusion between **Account** and **Upload** tabs 
    - On average, users ranked **4 out of 5** when assessing **difficulty** of this task (1 is “very difficult)
    - On average, users ranked **4 out of 5** when assessing **confusion** of this task (1 is “very confusing”) 
* Task 2 
    - Check and approve content uploaded to users song 
        - **3 out of 5** users succesful 
        - **Significant inefficiencies** and and confusion observed in regards to the **approval process** but successful interactions on the account page
    - On average, users ranked **3.4 out of 5** when assessing **difficulty** of this task 
    - On average, users ranked **3 out of 5** when assessing **confusion** of this task
* Task 3 
    - Check and find engagement statistics on your song just uploaded 
       - **5 out of 5** users successful
       - Users often clicked on **music** and **account** pages before the trending page. 
    - All user’s ranked **5 out of 5** when assessing the **difficulty** of this task. 
    - On average, users ranked **4 out of 5** when assessing **confusion** of this task
* Wrap-Up 
    - Users commonly **disliked** the approval process and found it to be confusing
